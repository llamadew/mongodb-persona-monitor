    objective: Develop the most technically advanced product catalog app using as many of Springs tools as possible.
    quote: I'm not a pacifist but I love non-blocking.  I'm about to get some project reactor up in here.
    tools:
      - Spring
      - IntelliJ
      - start.spring.io
      - Maven/Gradle
      - Vim
      - Samsung Galaxy 7 Edge 
    behaviors:
      - Reads every blog post and tweet from Dave Syer
      - Works closely with the Platform Team to get the most out of PCF.
      - Has a few personal projects on github
      - Develops apps for many products/projects
      - Creates "schedule" based tasks using Spring Cloud Tasks
      - Uses the CF CLI and API more than GUIs like Appsman.
    needs:
      - To provide a stable application for application operators to manage.
      - A tool to facilitate cleaning up abandondoned shopping carts on a time interval.
      - A fresh pot of coffee after lunch to make sure code gets checked in before 5.
      - A way to monitor batch application execution history in PCF.
    frustrations:
      - Having to do things "the old way" because that thing isn't on PCF.
      - Too many tools and services to keep track of outside of PCF.
